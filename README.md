## Author
I'm Sebastian K. Erben. You can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/SebastianKErben), on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/SebastianKErben) and of course on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/SebastianKErben). I love to play and create videogames and I am also the co-founder of [Bit2Good](http://www.bit2good.com).

Due to our work at Bit2Good I know that certain problems reoccur all the time when developing games with Unity3D. That's why I decided to work on a library that can be reused in every Unity3D project. This is what SKE.Unity3D is and I hope it will be useful for more developers than just myself :)
